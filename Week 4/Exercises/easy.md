## 99 Bottles of Beer ##

The classic song '99 Bottles of Beer on the Wall' is a classic of most bus trips and could probably be done without but it's here nonetheless. The song is: 

> 99 bottles of beer on the wall, 99 bottles of beer.
> Take one down and pass it around, 98 bottles of beer on the wall.
> 98 bottles of beer on the wall, 98 bottles of beer.
> Take one down and pass it around, 97 bottles of beer on the wall.
> 97 bottles of beer on the wall, 97 bottles of beer.
> Take one down and pass it around, 96 bottles of beer on the wall.
> 96 bottles of beer on the wall, 96 bottles of beer.
> Take one down and pass it around, 95 bottles of beer on the wall.

And so on until: 

> 1 bottle of beer on the wall, 1 bottle of beer.
> Take one down and pass it around, no more bottles of beer on the wall.
> No more bottles of beer on the wall, no more bottles of beer. 
> Go to the store and buy some more, 99 bottles of beer on the wall.


The challenge is to write a piece of code that outputs the song, as nobody can be bothered to type it out.
