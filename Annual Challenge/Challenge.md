Computer Club 2012 Annual Challenge
============================

The Annual Challenge is the ultimate challenge of the computer club year. As per the other challenges, it will be scored by the Code Golf Scorer. To win, you must produce the shortest amount of code possible, to obtain the lowest score from the scorer (you can run the scorer, it's just a python script):

## Prizes ##

Currently up for grabs:
- $30 iTunes Gift Card
- A Few Bags of lollies
- Eternal Glory

(Open to suggestions for things to add)

## Human Calculator ##

Note: This challenge is based on the Week 3 Exercise: https://github.com/pocon/Computer-Club/blob/master/Week%203/Exercises/medium.md but it has added a few more features to the calculator (so read carefully below) and needs to be compressed into smaller pieces of code.

Build a calculator which parses human language input (one to *twenty*) to compute simple maths.
You are allowed to import math, although the statement "import math" will count

### Must Support: ###

- Addition (+) - plus
- Subtraction (-) - minus
- Division (/) - divided_by
- Multiplication (*) - times
- Modulus (%) - mod
- Pi as a number (correct to at least 4 d.p.) - pi

### Example ###

    Enter a Calculation: one plus three
    4
    Enter a Calculation: Two minus SiX
    -4
    Enter a Calculation: Six divided_by three
    2
    Enter a Calculation: ten times EiGhTeen
    180
    Enter a Calculation: twelve mod 7
    5
    Enter a Calculation: pi times 1
    3.1416

Note that numbers (including pi) can be in any form of capitalisation.


## Submission ##

Two computer club sessions will be devoted as time towards this, with help from any other members, including myself.

The winner will be announced at our end of year party on 27 NOV 12.

Submissions are due NLT Lunchtime Monday (let's say 3 p.m.). If you forget, chuck an email and I'll see if I can add you in but no promises.

Make Sure you leave your name commented on the first line.
