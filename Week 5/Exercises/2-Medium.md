Medium Challenge
================

You go to pull out a boardgame but found your younger sister has eaten the dice. You are initially disappointed but then remember you can use your python skills to make your own dice.

The challenge is to randomly generate two dice, show each of them and the total.

For this, you will have to read the documentation on random here (the main part of this is learning to read documentation): http://docs.python.org/library/random.html

## Example ##

   Die 1: 3
   Die 2: 4
   Total: 7
